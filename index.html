          <h3>What is this?</h3>
          <p>
            Pretend you’re Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Crew.
            But today, your voyage isn’t across the Grand Line — it’s across your birthday.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a pirate-themed scavenger adventure built just for you.
            Each island hides a story, a clue, a treat, and maybe a test of courage.
            Your mission? Sail from island to island, clear every challenge, and uncover the legendary treasure known only as The One Piece.
          </p>
          </p>
            The sea’s calling, Captain — time to set sail for the greatest birthday voyage ever.

          <h3>How it works</h3>
          <ol class="tight">
            <li>Islands unlock at set times. Make sure to save this website and keep with you on Saturday. It will serve as your map for the rest of the day. Make sure to click complete button <strong> ONLY AFTER </strong> you clear the previous island.</li>
            <li>You’ll find directions and a fun hint (your Log Pose) for your next task once you unlock which island you have to go to. Always think two steps ahead. </li>
            <li>Complete every island, follow the story, and you’ll uncover your One Piece — the final reward waiting at the end of your adventure. </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Pro Tips for the Voyage</h3>
          <ul class="tight">
            <li>🍖 Don’t skip meals, Luffy.</li>
            <li>📍 Follow the directions when you're ready to sail to next spot</li>
            <li>🔊 Be sure to listen to your crewmates. They will serve as imperative guides</li>
            <li>📸 Take a photo at every island. The One Piece awaits proof.</li>
            <li> 🗺️ If you get lost, blame Nami (aka Farhin). </li>
            <li>💡 You’ll know what the final treasure is when you see it! </li>
            <li> ❤️ Remember, it's about the journey. Follow this website. Have fun. Enjoy the ride! </li>

          <p>Happy Birthday, Rohit! </p>
          <p>I can’t believe it’s been more than a year since I planned your last birthday. It feels like just yesterday I was bossing people around to make sure the details of your 20th birthday were perfect. While I don’t have my operations assistants or a crew of over 100 kids to help celebrate, I hope you enjoy all the surprises in store and feel just as loved. Maybe you’ll even get to find the One Piece 👀.</p>
          <p>As we take the time to celebrate the turning of a new age, I’d like to first take a minute to reflect back all that you’ve accomplished this past year. In the span of one year you got into Columbia (a goal you’ve been working towards for over 4 years). You completed your first summer internship during college. You secured your second internship, not even a full semester into Columbia. You’ve competed in two hackathons where you’ve been recognized for certain awards. You are truly one of the smartest people I know. And what’s crazy is sometimes you don’t even see it hiding behind your shoulder shrugging “I’m just a nonchalant guy” demeanor. But I’m very proud of you for what you’ve accomplished. You truly do work hard and you deserve all these good things that have happened.  </p>
          <p>However, what’s more important than you being smart (and I know you’re going to hate me for saying it over and over again) is your resilience. I don’t think you realize sometimes how many people in your shoes would’ve given up half way. Heck, I’ve given up halfway sometimes. But you don’t. You stick things through till the very end until you finally achieve the goal. I know your first couple of months at Columbia may not have been what you expected. But I know in true Rohit fashion you’ll come out on the other side with everything you wanted and more. </p>
          <p>Secondly, I really am very appreciative to have met you. You’re such a kind and steadfast person. In times where I’ve struggled and wavered you’ve always been calm. If someone were to ask me what made me fall in love with you, I wouldn’t say it was your intelligence (though it is a remarkable quality). I wouldn’t say it was your kindness (though that is a good guess). I wouldn’t say it was your good looks (though that doesn’t hurt). It was your steadiness and support you gave others. Back when we used to work together I used to wonder what made us such a good team. I used to think our strengths and weaknesses just match. While there may be a drop of truth in that I was able to work so well with you because of how strong and steady you were. Even when I was stressed, worried, and panicking, I would look at you as if so long as he’s here it’ll be okay. It was that quality that allowed me to focus on what I loved to do because I knew behind the scenes you were always there watching my back. Thank you for that, I don’t know what I would’ve done without you during those times.</p>
          <p>I know we’ve had our ups and down. Man, even in the week of creating this website and planning your birthday it wasn’t necessarily one of our best weeks. But I want you to know that no matter what happens, I will always be grateful for you. They say love is not a feeling but a choice. No matter what I may be feeling that will never change how appreciative I am for all the things you’ve done, all the flaws of mine you’ve overlooked, and memories/lessons I’ve learned from being with you, I know you go through things as well that you don’t share even with me. You have your own struggles just like everyone else. But you’re a good person Rohit and good things will happen to you. The day you’re sitting in your high rise, high ceiling, unnecessarily tech apartment I’ll be able to say I told you so. I hope I will be sitting next to you to be able to share it. </p>
          <p>Happy birthday my love. I hope 21 is even better than 20. You deserve the world. MWUAH!</p>
          <p>— Love, Farhin 💙</p>
